# Digital Image Processing Using Python and OpenCV â€“ Udemy Course

This repository contains the code and practical exercises developed throughout the Udemy course **"Digital Image Processing Using Python and OpenCV"**. The course focused on applying Python and OpenCV to solve a wide range of problems in image processing and computer vision.

## What I Learned:
- Fundamentals of digital image processing
- Image reading, writing, and display using OpenCV
- Color spaces and transformations (RGB, HSV, Grayscale)
- Image filtering, blurring, and edge detection
- Thresholding techniques and morphological operations
- Contour detection and image segmentation
- Object detection basics using image features
- Real-time image processing with webcam input

This project serves as a personal reference and a practical resource for anyone looking to explore the power of Python and OpenCV in the field of computer vision.
